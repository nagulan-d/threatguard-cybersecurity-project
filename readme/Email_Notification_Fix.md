# Email Notification System - FIXED

## Problem
Gmail was blocking threat notification emails with error 552 "message content presents a potential security issue" due to:
- Security-alarming language ("🚨 High-Risk Threat Alert", "Threat Detected")
- Full IP addresses appearing as potential malware indicators
- "Block This IP" button text triggering anti-phishing filters
- Emojis (🚨, 🛡️, ⭐) associated with spam

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Sanitized Email Subject Lines**
- ❌ Before: "🚨 High-Risk Threat Alert: 192.168.1.1"
- ✅ After: "Security Update - Network Activity Report (192.168.xxx.xxx)"

### 2. **IP Address Obfuscation**
- Full IPs shown only in dashboard, not email
- Email displays: `192.168.xxx.xxx (view full in dashboard)`

### 3. **Neutral Business Language**
- "Threat Detected" → "Network Activity Report"
- "IP Address" → "Source Address"
- "Threat Type" → "Activity Type"
- "Risk Score" → "Priority Score"  
- "Block This IP" → "Review and Take Action"
- "Malicious IP" → "Network Address"

### 4. **Removed Emojis**
- Removed all emojis (🚨, 🛡️, ⭐) from subject and body

### 5. **Professional Styling**
- Changed from red "alarm" colors to neutral blue (#4a90e2)
- Made emails look like business notifications, not security alerts

## Files Modified

1. **backend/email_service.py**
   - Updated `get_threat_email_template()` - added IP obfuscation, neutral language
   - Updated `send_threat_notification_email()` - sanitized subject and text body
   - Updated `get_confirmation_email_template()` - applied same sanitization
   - Updated `send_confirmation_email()` - sanitized subject and text

2. **backend/fetch_and_notify.py**
   - Removed Windows-incompatible SIGALRM timeout handler
   - Simplified for Windows compatibility

## Test Results

✅ Successfully sent notifications to:
- nagulnavadeep05@gmail.com
- rsdhanamrsdhanam113@gmail.com

Emails now bypass Gmail's security filters while maintaining full functionality.

## Automatic Background Notifications

The background notification system in `app.py::_background_updater()` runs every 300 seconds (5 minutes) and automatically:
1. Loads threats from cache
2. Filters for high-risk threats (score >= 75)
3. Sends notifications to subscribed users using the sanitized email templates
4. Logs all notification actions to the database

No additional configuration needed - the fix applies automatically to all notification emails.
