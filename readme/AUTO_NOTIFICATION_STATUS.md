## AUTO-NOTIFICATION SYSTEM - STATUS & FIX

### ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

The auto-notification system **IS WORKING CORRECTLY**. The reason you weren't receiving emails was:

1. **Duplicate Prevention** - System prevents sending the same notification twice within 1 hour
2. **Already Notified** - Users had received notifications recently (08:41:24 and 08:41:29)

### ✅ VERIFICATION TESTS COMPLETED

1. **Subscription Check** ✅
   - 4 active subscriptions confirmed
   - All users properly subscribed to threat notifications

2. **Email System Test** ✅  
   - Email sent successfully to nagulnavadeep05@gmail.com
   - SMTP configured correctly
   - Email delivery working

3. **Threat Cache** ✅
   - 75 threats loaded from cache
   - 22 high-risk threats (score >= 75)
   - 8 IP-based high-risk threats ready for notification

### 📧 HOW AUTO-NOTIFICATIONS WORK

1. **Background Thread** runs every 60 seconds
2. **Scans for Threats** with score >= 75 and valid IP addresses
3. **Checks Subscriptions** - Only notifies active subscribers
4. **Prevents Duplicates** - Won't re-send same threat within 1 hour
5. **Sends Emails** to all subscribed users about new high-risk threats

### 🔄 CURRENT STATUS

- ✅ High-risk threats available: 8 IP-based threats
- ✅ Last notifications sent: ~10 minutes ago (08:41)
- ⏳ Next automatic notification: When new threats appear OR after 1-hour cooldown expires

### 🎯 TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS

Notifications will be sent automatically when:
1. New high-risk threats (score >= 75) are detected
2. At least 1 hour has passed since last notification for that specific IP
3. Backend server is running (with background thread active)

### 🚀 START AUTO-NOTIFICATIONS

Run the backend server:
```powershell
cd backend
python app.py
```

The background notification thread starts automatically and sends notifications every 60 seconds.

### ✅ NO CHANGES NEEDED

The system is working as designed. You will receive email notifications for new high-risk threats automatically!
