## 🎯 Success Indicators

When auto-blocking is working correctly, you'll see:

1. **Alert Popup**: "🛡️ Auto-Blocked X high-risk threats!" (1-2 sec after dashboard load)
2. **Console Messages**: [AUTO-BLOCK] messages in backend console
3. **Dashboard Table**: "Auto-Blocked High-Risk Threats" section populated with IPs
4. **Database Records**: BlockedThreat entries with reason "Auto-blocked"
5. **Audit Log**: ThreatActionLog entries with action "auto_block"

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### To Test Immediately
1. Start backend: `python app.py`
2. Start frontend: `npm start`
3. Login as admin
4. Go to Admin Dashboard
5. Watch for alert and view auto-blocked IPs

### To Customize
- **Change threshold**: Modify line 1643 in app.py (currently 75)
- **Change delay**: Modify line 330 in AdminDashboard.js (currently 1000ms)
- **Disable auto-trigger**: Comment out useEffect in AdminDashboard.js

### To Monitor
- Check console logs for [AUTO-BLOCK] messages
- Query database for BlockedThreat records
- Review ThreatActionLog for action="auto_block"
- View admin dashboard for real-time updates

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### If No Alert Appears
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify admin JWT token is valid
- Check backend console for [AUTO-BLOCK] messages
- Ensure recent_threats.json exists and has threats

### If Table is Empty
- No high-risk threats in current feed (score < 75)
- All threats already blocked
- Click "Scan & Block Now" to manually trigger

### If IPs Not Blocked
- Check database (blocked_threat table)
- Verify ip_blocker.py is working
- Check backend error logs
